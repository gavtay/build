# Study Buddy

This website will serve as a study buddy. It allows you to focus on your study material better.

It will be similar to the pomodoro timer, and take up your screen. You will be able to change the color to whatever you want. It will have a timer option, pause button / start button. Change time / setting button.

The difference will be that you can include a posture reminder, and a water break reminder that will alert you every x amount of time.

The site will be made with HTML, CSS and JS. The backend will either be made with Java and Spring, or with JS. I will decide on the backend at another time. I do not plan to use a frontend framework so that I can get the foundations of HTML CSS and JS down better.
